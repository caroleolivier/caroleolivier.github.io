title: Tech lead scribbles - delegating

I had to learn to delegate to enjoy (and "survive" haha) being a tech lead.

There are many reasons for delegating work:

1. **You can't do it all on your own**
<br>Tech leads are 1st point of contact for many things. When somebody asks you whether you can do something, it's not you they're asking, it's *your team*.
<br>I had to learn to rethink not just as me, but as a whole team.

2. **You want to empower your team**
<br>Your peers want to learn and grow. The more you delegate, the more chances you give them to learn, show they can do it and shine.

This being said, it's a lot easier said than done.
<br>Things won't be done like you'd have done them. We all have our styles.
<br>You don't want to overload your peers.
<br>Mistakes will be made.

But it's all worth it. Your peers will feel empower. And as a bonus, you'll get more time to do the things you love and grow yourself.
