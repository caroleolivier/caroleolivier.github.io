title: Cycling in London

I started cycling in London and to work about 18 months ago. I was trying to find ways to shorten my commute of 50 minutes (not that long but still, it is almost two hours every day). A few girls at my previous company cycled to work and it got me curious. Cycling in London had always seemed way too dangerous to me but talking to my colleagues I realised they weren’t crazy cyclists ready to risk their lives every day (haha), they were quite the opposite, i.e. very reasonable and careful people. So I decided to give it go and here is how I did it.


First of all, I needed to find out whether cycling to work was for me. I didn’t have a bike, a helmet or anything so the first challenge was to test whether I liked cycling without any cycling equipment.
<br />
In London we are quite lucky, anyone can rent a Boris bike (now called Santander bike). However, I wasn’t ready to go on the road on my own, I was too intimidated (and scared!). But, I was lucky enough at the time to work for a company that had signed up to the [Cycle to Work Scheme](https://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/). Among other things it offered an hour long lesson to its employee willing to try out cycling to work. It didn’t require any equipment so it was perfect. I took my lesson over lunch with a volunteer who came to my office with two bikes. We cycled around the office for the whole hour and regularly stopped so that he could give me a few tips (where to stay on the road, what to watch out for, etc...). We started on very quiet roads and moved on to busier ones with buses, lorries, etc… It was great. It made me realise I was quite comfortable and that could work.
<br />
So my first tip is try to find a free lesson with a volunteer willing to cycle with you and share his tips about how to behave on the road: check with your company, your council, [TfL](https://tfl.gov.uk/), they are likely be able to help.


Next I met with a few colleagues who cycled to work. They shared their tips with me, nothing groundbreaking that you can’t find out on the Internet so I won’t list them, but the great part was that I could completely identify myself with them. They weren't professionalist cyclists or anything like that so if they were doing it then there were no reasons why I couldn't.
<br />
So my tip here is to try to demystify cycling to work. I am sure you can find people like you who cycle to work so talk to them. It is not just for the professional cyclists with the full gear, it is for everyone.


At this point, I had decided to give it a real try so I needed the equipment. I went to a first shop where I was pretty much left on my own to choose my bike. I was intimidated and feeling lost among all those bikes, I had no idea where to start, what a reasonable price was, what bike I wanted/needed. It was really overwhelming. The next shop I went to was a totally different experience. One of the shop assistant helped me with everything and gave me very good advices about the bike, the price range, the helmet, the lights, etc… It was exactly what I needed: I didn’t have an opinion about anything because I had zero knowledge so I needed somebody to make those decisions for me. I left fully equipped and as bonuses full of useful tips, it was great.
<br />
So when it comes to buying your equipment, my tip here is to find a shop and a shop assistant you feel you can trust and who is going to help you choose your equipment. Or find a friend who is willing to come with you and play that role.


After that shopping experience, I was almost ready to commute to work. The last thing I needed was to find a good route. There are a lot of good sources. The ones I used were my colleagues (again!), the phone app [CityMapper](https://citymapper.com/company) (there is a great option to see quiet, regular or fast routes) and [TfL](https://tfl.gov.uk/)'s website. With that information I designed my first route. However, I didn’t want to try it on a Monday morning when it is busy and I have to make regular stops to figure out whether I am lost or where to go next. So I cycled to work for the first time on a Sunday :o) It all went well and I tried again the following Sunday because I wanted to practice a bit more and try a different route. Sundays are great as there are less cars, no lorries, less buses and people are generally more relaxed on the road.
<br />
And so that way I decided on my commute route. My tip this time it to use weekends or anytime when the roads are not busy to try out routes and get more practice before you start commuting. Inevitably you will face traffic at some point and it is better if the only thing you have to focus on are cars instead of cars plus route plus standing right on your bike.

<br />



And that’s it! I am now one of those crazy cyclists you can see on the road :) I am not cycling every day of the week but when I do it is quite enjoyable. Inevitably you will have a fright now and then but overall if you are vigilant and choose your route carefully cycling to work can be a pleasant experience.
