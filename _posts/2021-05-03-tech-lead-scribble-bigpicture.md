Another little scribble to capture things I do.

I always try to keep in mind how different pieces of work fit together.

While engineers are busy developing new features and focusing on the low level details, I make sure we don't forget about the big picture: why we're doing what we're doing, how well it'll fit with that other piece of work.

Note: I'm not quite sure big picture is the right term, I may edit this post later.
