title: Building a culture of self-service - detective skill 🕵️‍♀️
date: 2024-03-24

I've been thinking about how to build a culture of self-service where people don't block each other and, quite the opposite, empower each other.

In my previous [post](https://caroleolivier.github.io/blog/2024/03/03/culture-self-service-sharing) I share how sharing (pun, ha!) is important.  
Here I want to talk about what I call the `detective skill 🕵️‍♀️`.  
Knowledge is very important, but learning how to find/acquire knowledge is as important in my opinion. And this is what I want to talk about here.

## 2. Learn and Teach _how_ to find the answer, not just the answer

Whenever you ask a question, don't just settle for the answer, ask **how** you can find the answer yourself.

> And become a great detective 🕵️‍♀️.

For instance:

- _what time is the weekly meeting?_  
  answer: 6pm Monday  
  how to find the answer: check the team calendar

- _is service X deployed?_  
  answer: yes  
  how to find the answer: check the status page at somewhere.com

These are trivial examples, but you can apply this logic to everything.

👉 So if you've asked a question, make sure you understand how to find the answer next time.

👉 And similarly! If you're asked a question, be generous and don't just give the answer. That's the easy part. Grow your colleague and show them how to find the answer on their own next time.
