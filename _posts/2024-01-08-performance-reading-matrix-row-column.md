title: Performance of reading a matrix by columns or rows in JavaScript
date: 2024-01-08
---

I wrote a little script to compare how long it'll take to read a matrix (array of arrays) depending on whether I access it by rows or columns.

Reading by rows is faster than reading by columns.

This is because the JavaScript engine stores arrays as contiguous space in memory (as much as it can and I guess?). I had a quick look at V8 and can't easily find that information.  
I guess there will also be variation depending of whether the array has a fixed size or not? If one keeps adding elements to an array, its size will vary and maybe it won't be stored contiguously?

[EDIT] Found this StackOverflow [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37645340/does-v8-still-have-c-style-arrays-that-are-contiguous-blocks-of-memory-and-how) which seems to say the same thing.

Here are the results:

- 100,000,000 x 8: ~ 900ms vs 8,200ms
- 8 x 100,000,000: ~ 400ms vs 1,200ms
- 50000 x 50000: ~ 1,500ms vs 3,000ms
