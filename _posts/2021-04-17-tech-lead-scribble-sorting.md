Continuing with the tech lead scribble series, another thing I do a lot is sorting and prioritising anything directed to my team.
<br>The `anything` can really be anything: product question (why this smart meter not working), infrastructure change request (you need to migrate to a new Kubernetes cluster), people question, etc...

Note for self: it looks like I think bottom to top rather than top to bottom ðŸ¤”
