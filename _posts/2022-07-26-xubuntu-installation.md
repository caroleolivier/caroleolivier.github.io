title: Installing Xubuntu on an old laptop

I've got an old laptop I wanted to use to play with Linux.  
Its spec is not super performant so I decided to install a lighter version than Ubuntu and came across [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/).

This is what I did to get Xubuntu up and running:

1. Downloaded Xubuntu on my Mac from [here](https://xubuntu.org/download/)

2. Created a [Live USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB) with [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

3. Booted my old laptop from USB storage (F12 on startup to enter the BIOS boot menu)

It took about 30 mins to install the distribution and that was it :)
