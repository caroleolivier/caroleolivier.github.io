Heapfiles contain the data of a single table.  
They're saved as rows and are unordered.

They're divided into page of fixed size of 8kB.

ðŸ’¡ This fixed size helps with managing disk space and memory as it corresponds to the block size the OS operates with when it does I/O operations.

ðŸ’¡ Adjacent pages are faster to read.

What happens when a file is larger and can't contain all records??

## Free Space Management

Basically for each heapfile, there's an extra file called heapfile*\_fsm*.  
It's used to indicate the free space in a heapfile.

The way it works is by building a tree to indicate the maximum free space in a file with its location.

ðŸ’¡ There are utilities to explore the fsm files.  
This command helps with this: `create extension if not exists pg_freespacemap;`

Now when running this command, one can view how many pages (blocks) are needed to store the data of 1 heapfile.

```
SELECT *
FROM pg_freespace('table_name');
```

ðŸ’¡ It's possible to force a compression of the heapfiles, not sure whether the db do it automatically or whether it's good practice to do it regularly.

Another great video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep87Pskkp14&list=PL1XF9qjV8kH0ghGRGo3_f-FWqWvAbv1dh&index=5) with this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFN4maoWkYA&list=PL1XF9qjV8kH0ghGRGo3_f-FWqWvAbv1dh&index=11) with Tetris row haha.

## Vacuuming

When exploring the FSM, it's good to run the VACUUM [command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html) to force the heapfiles and fsm to be up-to-date:

```
$ VACUUM table_name;
```
