I had a screening interview a couple of days ago and to help me prepare for it I wrote down a kind of todo list.


#### Research the company

##### Company business
* what is the industry?
* what is their mission?
* how do they make money?
* where do they operate?
* what is their market share?

##### Company history
* when was it created?
* by whom?
* why?
* what does the future look like?

##### Company structure
* what is the size? (how many employees?)
* what does the orgchart look like? (size of the board? how many layers of management?)
* where are their offices?

##### Company culture
* do they have core values?
* how do they compare to competitors?

##### Company and you
* do you believe in their mission?
* would you be proud to be working for them?
* could you grow there?
* what could you bring?


#### Research the role

##### Role description
* what is the main task? (back-end developer? front-end developer? technical lead? etc...)
* what is the level of responsibilities?
* what is the level of expertise?
* what does the team do?
* who are the primary customers? other interactions?

##### Role progression
* are they opportunities to grow?
* how to they evaluate employees?

##### Role and you
* would you be excited to do the job on a daily basis?
* do you fit the candidate description? if not, how much does it matter?
* what would bring to the job?
* what would you bring to the team?
* how would you progress?


#### Preparing questions

##### About the company

##### About the role

##### Practicality
* what is the interview process? who will you meet?
* when will you hear from them next?
