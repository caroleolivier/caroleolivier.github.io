title: Tech lead scribbles - orchestrating

I spent a non negligible part of my time planning and coordinating, which I see as **orchestrating**.

For instance, I work with my product manager to plan the quarter, I have check-ins with my team members to know how they're doing, I organise many of our ceremonies.

This part of my role is really important. It's another non technical aspect of the job, but it's critical.
<br>You can have the best engineers on the team, if they don't work well together or don't know where they're going, you'll waste energy and won't deliver (on top of being frustrated).
