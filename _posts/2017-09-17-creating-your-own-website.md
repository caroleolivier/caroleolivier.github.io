2) Setting up with github
2.1) doc from Jonathan Mc
2.2) testing locally

Today, I thought I'll share my experience setting my own website. I'll walk you through why I decided to go for github, then how and finally what is next.

Today I decided to set up my own website. Needless to say there are tons of solutions available. You could be using super user-friendly sites like WordPress, Blogspot  or slightly more advanced solutions like static sure generator Hugo or xx or even go bold and do it from scratch using HTML/CSS/JavaScript to write the content, AWS to host your web server and have fun setting your entire build process.

Tbh I didn't do a very deep analysis of all these solutions but I wanted an easy-to-setup solution, customizable, very well documented and with the least external dependencies.
