title: Important news about the hamburger emoji

For those of you reading my blog, I thought I would bring your attention to a very important piece of information: [Google fixed the burger emoji in Android 8.1](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/28/whew-google-fixed-the-burger-emoji-in-android-8-1/). Yep, that's right, the Android emoji used to have the cheese at the bottom, but they are "fixing" it:

<br/>
I wonder how much work is required for this change to go live. Creating a new image for the burger is easy but then what is the process of getting it released?

I googled for a little while to try to find the detailed release of Android 8.1 and found quite a few sources of information:
* Android 8.1 [release notes](https://developer.android.com/preview/api-overview.html) (this link may be broken or point to a different release as it points to the latest Android preview)
* Release notes on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history#Android_8.1_Oreo_.28API_27.29)

And then for the emojis:
* [Emojipedia Google](https://emojipedia.org/google/)
* [Emojipedia Hamburger](https://emojipedia.org/hamburger/)
* [Android 8.0 emojis](https://emojipedia.org/google/android-8.0/)

Somehow these pages must be updated. I can only hope they have a good automated process for that!

This search led me to this [article](http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/10/25/android-8-1-feature-spotlight-new-oreo-easter-egg-appears-double-stuf-form-octopus-remains/) about an Android Easter egg. I had absolutely no idea it existed. If you have an Android phone have fun! If you don't check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XCUyy6eIW8).

Yep, I needed a break today, as I like to say, it happens to everyone.

PS: if you need some distraction, I can only recommend reading the twitter [thread](https://twitter.com/baekdal/status/924312294439444480) about Google hamburger emoji, it is hilarious (IMO).
