title: Making my website accessible
date: 2019-04-17

I have finally revamped my website and made it accessible.

It was a lot more sophisticated before, but accessibility wise, it was terrible : lack of semantic html, missing caption, bad contrast.

I decided to give up fanciness for simpleness. And I love it so much more.
<br/>
It feels more in phase with my personality: I love simple and functional things.

Here are some of the things I changed:
* Wrap the navigation menu into a nav element
* Added a caption to the table containing my list of blog posts
* Wrap the footer into a footer element
* Change the style of links
* Fix the headings (I am still going through the list of blog posts)
* Add missing html language

There are still a few things I need to look into:
* Double h1 header
<br/>If you go to a blog post, you'll notice two h1 headers. My name and the title of the blog post. I am not sure how to solve this yet.
* Page title
* Mobile accessibility
<br/>The font size is super tiny. My website isn't super responsive, I am not really good at CSS and if I am honest, I don't really enjoy it ðŸ˜¬

I hope I haven't forgotten anything major, let me know if you notice anything please, I am reachable on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carole-olivier-2b845955/).
