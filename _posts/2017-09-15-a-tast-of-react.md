title: A taste of React

I have been developping web applications for over a year now using [Angular 1.4](https://angularjs.org/). But with the web development ecosystem moving so fast I have wanted to get my hands dirty with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for a while. (Although I might be a little late and maybe React belongs to the past already, who knows!).

So yesterday, I went through this great [tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) on React's official [website](https://facebook.github.io/react/). It took me about a day to go through everything and I feel like it has given me a very good idea of what React's core concepts are.

The tutorial starts with an installation section. For newbies like me there are two recommended options: use CodePen or use a script called Create React App that creates the skeleton of a React app. FYI If you are completely new to web development, you will still need to install Node.js and npm for it work. I chose the first option and used Creact React App because I prefer to use my local dev environment rather than CodePen and also I wanted to push my code to github.

Create React App is really easy to use and worked like a charm. I played a bit with the created app before starting and deleted a few things I didn't know were for. I'll probably find out later.

Once everything was setup I moved on to Hello World and the rest of the tutorial. It introduces the main concepts like JSX, elements, components, props, state, etc... at a very good pace (i.e. not too slow not too fast) and with good examples and finishes up with a sort of exercise "Thinking in React" which is really good to apply what had just been learnt. I highly recommend reading each section individually without looking ahead at the suggested solution. Not only is it more fun but it also forces you to really "Think in React" :)
