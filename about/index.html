    <h2>TL/DR</h2>

    <h3>Me</h3>
    <p>
        I am a problem solver and a builder.
        For that, I mostly use my skills and experience as a fullstack engineer.
        <br/>
        It's a great job, I feel really lucky to be doing it.
        <br/>
        I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> right now, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C#</a> I miss you (or any statically typed languages).
        <br/>
    </p>
    <h2>Private</h2>
    <h3>Sport</h3>
    <p>
        I looooove sport, any type, that's how I unwind.
        <br/>
        At the moment I do triathlon (<a href="http://www.220triathlon.com/beginners/what-are-the-different-triathlon-distances/11753.html" target="_blank">short distance</a>).
        <br/>
        I love it!
    </p>
    <h3>"Not sport"</h3>
    <p>
        When I don't do sport, I do like everybody else.
        <br/>
        I eat, I sleep, I see my family, my friends.
        <br/>
        I often have something new going on. At the moment, I'm learning how to properly sew.
    </p>
    <h3>My values</h3>
    <p>
        Honesty and open mindedness.
        <br/>
        They force you to be vulnerable.
        <br/>
        This is tough, but they are keys to be better.
    </p>

    There's nothing to read into it. I started using it when I started programming because I love Mario Bros, that's it.
