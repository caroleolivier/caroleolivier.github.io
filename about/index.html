    <h2>TL/DR</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Carole, I'm a software engineer.
        <br/>
        I'm not sure how you ended up here but hello to you :)
        <br/>
        In this blog, I collect learnings and thoughts I have. Let me know if you find something useful that needs further thinking.

    <h3>Me</h3>
    <p>
        I am a problem solver and you can throw pretty much anything at me.
        <br/>
        There aren't many things I won't be interested in.
        <br/>
        But most problems I work on right now are software related. This is my craft.
        <br/>
        And I feel very lucky to be operating in this space.

    <h2>Private</h2>
    <h3>Sport</h3>
    <p>
        I looooove sport, any type, that's how I unwind.
        <br/>
        At the moment I do triathlon (mainly <a href="http://www.220triathlon.com/beginners/what-are-the-different-triathlon-distances/11753.html" target="_blank">short distance</a>).
        <br/>
        I love it!
    </p>
    <h3>"Not sport"</h3>
    <p>
        When I don't do sport, I do like everybody else.
        <br/>
        I eat, I sleep, I see my family, my friends.
        <br/>
        I often have something new going on like crochet or sewing or building a keyboard.
    </p>
    <h3>My values</h3>
    <p>
        Honesty and open mindedness.
        <br/>
        They force you to be vulnerable.
        <br/>
        This is tough, but they are keys to be better.

    There's nothing to read into it.
    </br>
    I started using it when I started programming because I love Mario Bros, that's it.
