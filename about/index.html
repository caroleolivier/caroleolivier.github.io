    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <p>
        I am a software engineer.

    <h3>Me</h3>
    <p>
        I am a problem solver and a builder.
        <br/>
        I use my skills and experience as a fullstack engineer.
        <br/>
        It's a fun job.
        <br/>
        I use TypeScript right now, C# I miss you (or any statically typed languages).
        <br/>
    </p>
    <h2>Private</h2>
    <h3>Sport</h3>
    <p>
        I am a big fan of sport, any type, that's how I unwind.
        <br/>
        At the moment I do triathlon (short distance).
        <br/>
        I love it.
    </p>
    <h3>Not sport</h3>
    <p>
        When I don't do sport, I do like everybody else.
        <br/>
        I eat, I sleep, I see my family, my friends.
        <br/>
        Occasionally I do some craft (crochet is cool).
    </p>
    <h3>My values</h3>
    <p>
        Honesty and open mindedness.
        <br/>
        They force you to be vulnerable.
        <br/>
        This is tough, but they are keys to be better.
    </p>
